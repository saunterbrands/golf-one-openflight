## Overview

OpenFlight is an open-source golf launch monitor that uses Doppler radar to measure ball speed, club speed, launch angle, spin rate, and carry distance.

### What It Measures

- **Ball Speed**: 30-220 mph range with ±0.5% accuracy (OPS243-A)
- **Club Speed**: Detected from pre-impact readings (OPS243-A)
- **Smash Factor**: Ball speed / club speed ratio
- **Launch Angle**: Vertical launch measured by K-LD7 angle radar
- **Club Path**: Horizontal aim direction measured by second K-LD7
- **Spin Rate**: Via rolling buffer I/Q analysis (~50-60% detection rate)
- **Carry Distance**: Computed from ball speed, launch angle, and spin

### Hardware at a Glance

| Component | What it does | ~Cost |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| OPS243-A Radar | Ball speed, club speed, spin | $249 |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Runs everything | $60 |
| 7" Touchscreen | Shows shot data | $46 |
| SparkFun SEN-14262 | Sound trigger for spin detection | $18 |
| K-LD7 (×2) + FTDI adapters | Launch angle + club path | $140 |
| Power supply + accessories | | $27 |
| **Total** | | **~$540** |

> The K-LD7 angle radars are optional. Without them you still get ball speed, club speed, smash factor, spin rate, and estimated carry. See the [full parts list](docs/PARTS.md) for details and links.

## Getting Started

### 1. Get the parts

See the **[Parts List](docs/PARTS.md)** for everything you need with purchase links.

### 2. Wire it up

Follow the **[Sound Trigger Wiring Guide](docs/sound-trigger-wiring.md)** to connect the SEN-14262 to the OPS243-A. The K-LD7 modules connect via USB — no wiring needed.

### 3. Set up the Pi

Follow the **[Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](docs/raspberry-pi-setup.md)** for OS installation, software setup, radar configuration, and auto-start.

### 4. Hit balls

```bash
# Default: rolling buffer mode with sound trigger
scripts/start-kiosk.sh

# With K-LD7 launch-angle geometry defaults
scripts/start-kiosk.sh --kld7-geometry

# Development mode (no hardware)
scripts/start-kiosk.sh --mock
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 or use the touchscreen.

### TV Display Mode

OpenFlight also serves a fullscreen-friendly browser display for tablets, TV browsers, or a Chrome tab cast to Chromecast.

1. Start OpenFlight as usual with `scripts/start-kiosk.sh`.
2. Find the OpenFlight host IP address on your LAN.
3. Open `http://<openflight-host-ip>:8080/display` from another laptop, tablet, or TV browser.
4. For Chromecast, open the display page in Chrome and use Chrome's built-in **Cast** feature to cast the tab.

This is browser/tab casting only. OpenFlight does not include native Cast SDK support yet.

## How It Works

### System Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐  USB/Serial  ┌─────────────┐  Callback   ┌─────────────┐  WebSocket  ┌─────────────┐
│  OPS243-A   │ ───────────▶ │   Launch    │ ──────────▶ │   Flask     │ ──────────▶ │   React     │

```

1. **Sound trigger fires** — SEN-14262 detects club impact, triggers OPS243-A HOST_INT
2. **OPS243-A dumps buffer** — Rolling buffer I/Q data is captured and analyzed for ball speed, club speed, and spin
3. **K-LD7 correlates** — The server uses the OPS243-A impact timestamp to find the matching ball burst in the K-LD7 ring buffer, extracting launch angle and club path
4. **Carry computed** — Ball speed + spin + launch angle → carry distance
5. **UI updates** — Shot data emitted via WebSocket to the React frontend

### Doppler Radar Basics

The OPS243-A transmits a 24 GHz signal. When it bounces off a moving object (the golf ball), the frequency shifts proportionally to the object's speed — this is the Doppler effect. At 24.125 GHz, each 1 mph of speed creates a ~71.7 Hz Doppler shift.

### Positioning

Place the radar **3-5 feet behind the tee**, pointing at the hitting area:

```
                Ball Flight Direction
                ======================>

[Tee]  ←--- 3-5 ft ---→  [OPS243-A]  [K-LD7 vertical]  [K-LD7 horizontal]
```

The K-LD7 modules are positioned near the OPS243-A, one mounted vertically (launch angle) and one horizontally (club path / aim direction).

## Configuration

### Radar Settings for Golf

| Setting     | Value    | Why                         |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Sample Rate | 20 kHz   | Supports up to ~139 mph     |
| Buffer Size | 512      | Faster updates (~10-15 Hz)  |
| Min Speed   | 10 mph   | Filter slow movements       |
| Direction   | Outbound | Ball moving away from radar |
| Power       | Max (0)  | Best detection range        |

### Python API

```python
from openflight import LaunchMonitor

with LaunchMonitor() as monitor:
    print("Swing when ready...")
    shot = monitor.wait_for_shot(timeout=60)

    if shot:
        print(f"Ball Speed: {shot.ball_speed_mph:.1f} mph")
        print(f"Est. Carry: {shot.estimated_carry_yards:.0f} yards")
```

## Limitations

- **Cosine error**: If ball doesn't travel directly toward/away from radar, measured speed will be slightly lower than actual
- **Spin detection**: ~50-60% reliable — depends on signal quality and trigger timing
- **K-LD7 speed aliasing**: The K-LD7 max speed is 62 mph, so it's used only for angle/distance, not speed

### Ball Markings

Reflective markings (aluminum stickers, painted dots) noticeably improve K-LD7 launch-angle extraction — the stronger return gives multi-frame tracking, higher SNR, and more confident angles. However, a specular patch produces a pulsed, non-sinusoidal amplitude modulation that the spin detector can't interpret as seam modulation, so measured spin degrades (typically locks to the top of the valid frequency band with low confidence). Low-confidence spin automatically falls back to club-typical values in the ballistics model, so the net effect of marking a ball is better angles with no worse carry estimates. A thin painted stripe (rather than a patch) is a reasonable middle ground if you want both — it rotates through the beam more like a seam.

## Hardware Diagnostic

To verify every component of your build in one shot:

```bash
uv run python scripts/hardware-test/diagnose.py
```

The diagnostic walks through 6 checks:
1. OPS243 connectivity
2. OPS243 rolling buffer mode persistence
3. OPS243 software trigger
4. K-LD7 vertical (launch angle)
5. K-LD7 horizontal (aim direction, optional)
6. Sound trigger end-to-end (interactive — prompts you to clap near the sensor)

Missing optional hardware (like the horizontal K-LD7) is reported as a skip rather than a failure. Pass `--require-all` to fail on skips, or `--no-interactive` to skip the sound-trigger prompt in unattended runs.
