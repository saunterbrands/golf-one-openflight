## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`--kld7` now delivers the full launch-angle pipeline by default.** Enabling
  the K-LD7 radars turns on the **two-ray multipath vertical launch-angle
  estimator** (per-frame demodulation that separates the ball from its floor
  reflection to recover true elevation instead of averaging across the
  multipath) plus the **ball-speed cosine correction** (OPS radial → true
  speed). Each shot is graded into a tour-derived Tier-1/Tier-2 confidence with
  a tour-average boost for suppressed reads; measurements that clear the
  physics guard but trip a soft consistency guard are shown as **marginal
  (one-dot) confidence** rather than silently replaced by the club estimate.
  Far-net flights are de-aliased past the FSK range wrap (`--net-distance`).
- `--kld7-mount-tilt` is **required** with `--kld7` (measure with a phone
  inclinometer — no safe default). `--kld7-angle-offset` defaults to the
  calibrated `1.5`.
- `--calculated-spin` (opt-in, off by default): replaces radar spin with the
  kinematic estimate `170·v·sin(LA)^1.2`; the measured value is retained in
  `spin_rpm_measured` for scoring.
- `--kld7-vertical-raw` test mode surfaces the raw radar angle for every shot
  (all display guards bypassed).
- Offline `scripts/analysis/session_shot_report.py` per-shot HTML report, a
  visual explainer (`docs/kld7-launch-angle-explained.html`), and a
  setup/usage guide (`docs/kld7.md`).

### Changed
- The vertical estimator is now a fixed cascade (two_ray → geometry →
  single-frame geometry → naive); it is no longer user-selectable. Launch-angle
  source and confidence semantics changed accordingly.
- `--experimental-kld7-raw-radc-logging` promoted to `--kld7-raw-logging` (it
  is the standard replay/review path, not an experiment).

### Removed
- `--kld7-vertical-estimator` (estimator is a fixed cascade), `--kld7-geometry`
  (kiosk preset), and `--ball-speed-cosine-correction` (folded into `--kld7`).
  `--kld7-bypass-vertical-gate` renamed to `--kld7-vertical-raw`.

### Fixed
- K-LD7 tracker: shots could silently lose their launch angle when the
  stream thread appended a frame while the shot path iterated the ring
  buffer (`snapshot_buffer` / `_radc_frames_for_extraction`). CPython
  raises `RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration` for this, and
  the server's broad K-LD7 exception handler swallowed it, so the shot
  was reported without an angle and no error was visible. Buffer reads
  now copy under a lock; appends and resets take the same lock.

### Changed
- Spin detection: drop the autocorrelation override branch. The autocorr
  peak inside the envelope search region often lands at minimum lag
  (~12000 RPM / upper rail) by spectral coincidence, which previously
  flipped legitimate mid-range FFT seam picks to the upper rail and got
  them rejected as bandpass-shoulder noise. The autocorr fallback still
  *confirms* the FFT pick when the two agree within 10%; disagreements
  are now logged for diagnostics but never replace the FFT result.
- Spin detection: lower `SPIN_SNR_MIN` from 3.0 → 2.5 so marginal but
  real seam tones are reported at low confidence instead of dropped.

### Added
- `scripts/analysis/replay_club_speed.py`: offline replay of a proposed
  MEDIAN club-speed picker against any session log. Builds the same
  candidate set the production picker uses, applies a 30 % magnitude
  floor, and reports the median speed for each `rolling_buffer_capture`
  alongside the originally logged (magnitude-pick) value, with smash
  factors as a physical sanity check. The script is exploratory and
  does not change production behaviour — it lets us inspect what a
  median-based picker would have produced before committing to a code
  change.
- `scripts/analysis/plot_spin_debug.py`: 4-panel diagnostic for a single
  `rolling_buffer_capture` (speed timeline, raw I/Q, bandpass envelope,
  envelope FFT spectrum) to inspect what the spin algorithm saw and why
  it accepted or rejected a shot.
- K-LD7 shot-correlation analysis workflow and theory writeup
